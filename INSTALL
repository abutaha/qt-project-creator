Thanks for downloading qt-project-creator.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.6 or greater installed. Also you need to be sure that the following dependencies are installed:

  - Linux/Windows:
     * pyqt4
     * python-setuptools
     * Good luck :)

Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install
